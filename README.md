# Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game

Welcome to the freeCodeAcademy project **Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game**! This project is designed to help you grasp the fundamentals of JavaScript programming while creating a text-based Role Playing Game (RPG).

## Introduction

In this project, you will learn JavaScript basics such as variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and DOM manipulation while building a text-based RPG. By the end of this project, you should have a solid understanding of how to use JavaScript to create interactive web applications.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **index.html**: This file contains the HTML structure of the game interface.
- **styles.css**: This file contains the CSS styles to enhance the appearance of the game interface.
- **script.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code to implement the game logic and functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freecodeacademy/learn-basic-js-rpg.git
```

2. Open the project directory in your favorite code editor.

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view and interact with the RPG.

## How to Play

Once you open the game in your web browser, you'll be presented with the RPG interface. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the game, make choices, and interact with different elements.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Gain a solid understanding of basic JavaScript concepts.
- Learn how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.
- Practice problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
